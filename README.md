Linux Evernote Client written in Rust

This is eventually intended to be a full Evernote client for Linux
written in Rust. Why Rust? Well, mostly because I'm interested in
the language and this is the best way to learn it.

Road Map

 * Phase 1 is just to be able to authenticate with Evernote
   and retrieve notes.
   
 * Phase 2 will be a command line Evernote client that will
   allow you to create and edit text notes using your favorite
   editor and Markdown.
   
 * Phase 3 will be adding file attachments, sound and graphics

 * Phase 4 will be a graphical user interface.
